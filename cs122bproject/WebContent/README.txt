Inside TimeResults folder, there contains a script called GetTimeResults that would take an input of a log file.
The script will look at each line, which contains TS and TJ. The script will grab each line, and add all the
numbers up to create the average time for search servlet and JDBC.
The results of the average Search servlet time(ms) and the average JDBC time(ms) will display on the terminal.
